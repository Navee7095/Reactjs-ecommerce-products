Developed a search functionality for an e-commerce platform using ReactJS. Implemented a product search feature that interacts with a RESTful API to fetch and display products based on user input.


**Key Features:**

•Used API calls to retrieve products from the provided API endpoint (https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=).

•Ensured a seamless user experience by displaying API-fetched products in a responsive, user-friendly UI.



**Environment:**

•ReactJS for front-end development.

•REST API for data fetching.

•CSS for styling the UI components.
